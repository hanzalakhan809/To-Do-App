# HOW TO RUN THE CODE

Prerequisites:

1.Node.js version 18.15.0: Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment that is used for building server-side applications. It is also required for running React projects. You can download the latest version of Node.js from their official website.

2. npm (Node Package Manager): npm is a package manager for Node.js that allows you to download and install packages and dependencies that are required for your React project. npm is included with Node.js, so you donâ€™t have to install it separately.

Once you have these prerequisites installed, you can follow these steps to download a React project from Github and run it on your computer:

1. Clone the repository.
2. run-> npm i  (this command will install all the necessary dependencies and module required for run the dev server).
3. npm run dev (this will run the devlopment server).
